Fenomic Acoustic Model

----


The system has been tested to run on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 10. It is written in
Python and Cython and requires the following libraries to run

numpy >= 1.6.0
cython >= 0.14.1

Building requires gcc and assumes some things about the way your Python
distribution was compiled. The defaults will probably work and have been
tested on both source-compiled Pythons and package managed ones through
apt-get on Ubuntu.

TO BUILD
--------
Run

    sh ./build/do

in a reasonable shell, or

    redo all

if djb redo is installed.


TO RUN
------

Run

    ./test.py

and it will train the acoustically matched model and output the best decodes
of the test instances along with its confidence. To change to the alphabetic
model, edit line 13 of the file test.py and change

    d = data.Data(alphabetic_baseforms = False)

to

    d = data.Data(alphabetic_baseforms = True)

then rerun ./test.py

Additionally, if you want to poke around in the outputs of the function, it's
possible to run the test file from within python as

    python -i test.py

making the global variables available.
